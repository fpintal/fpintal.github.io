            <h3>Evaluation</h3>

            <h4>Checklist &amp; Requirements</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>The submitted link leads directly to the home page to be reviewed.</li>
                <li> file and folder names avoid spaces and upper-case letters; if any remain, they should be renamed to follow the course convention.</li>
                <li>The page has strong contrast: dark header/footer with a white content area and readable black text.</li>
                <li>Font size and line spacing make the text easy to read; the welcome paragraph is short and scannable.</li>
                <li>The site appears to use a consistent external CSS file across pages for colors, fonts, and layout.</li>
                <li>CRAP principles:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Contrast:</strong> Black header/footer vs. white main content; orange call-to-action button stands out.</li>
                        <li><strong>Repetition:</strong> Repeated black bars at top and bottom, consistent button style and typography.</li>
                        <li><strong>Alignment:</strong> Content is centered within a clean main column; navigation is aligned across the top.</li>
                        <li><strong>Proximity:</strong> Heading, intro text, time button, and main image are grouped logically.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>The page includes a clear header, main, and footer structure.</li>
                <li>The header brand name “Fast Fuels” is prominent and works well as the site’s h1.</li>
                <li>The main area starts with “Welcome to Fast Fuels” as a heading; this could be adjusted to an h2 labeled “Home” so the page name is clearer while keeping the welcome text as supporting content.</li>
                <li>The brand/tagline (“Fast Fuels | 1036 Randolph Street, Thomasville, NC”) is repeated in the lower footer, reinforcing the location and identity.</li>
                <li>The footer contains an additional menu area and includes HTML and CSS validation links, which is great for meeting course requirements.</li>
                <li>Navigation (Home, About, Services, Gallery, Contact) is simple, clear, and appears consistent with the overall brand.</li>
                <li>The large hero image of the gas station is relevant and gives a real-world sense of the client’s site.</li>
                <li>The “Current Time” button adds a small interactive touch and makes the page feel more dynamic.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Stop / Start / Continue Feedback</h4>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stop:</strong> Avoid using multiple separate footer bars if they can be combined; the copyright bar and address/validator bar could be merged into one footer to reduce visual repetition.</li>
                <li><strong>Start:</strong> Consider adding a short tagline or one-sentence summary under the main “Fast Fuels” header on every page to reinforce what makes this gas station unique.</li>
                <li><strong>Continue:</strong> Continue using the strong black/white/orange color scheme, clear navigation, and large photography—these choices make the site feel professional and easy to use.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Additional Suggestions</h4>
            <h5>Gallery Page</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Some of the gallery images are not high quality and look a bit pixelated; using higher-resolution photos would make the site feel more polished.</li>
                <li>The gallery images are not all the same size, so when switching between gallery pages the layout jumps and the screen shifts. Making the images a consistent size would create a smoother user experience.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Contact Page</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>There is a small spelling/punctuation issue in the text “Location .using google api.” — this could be cleaned up to something like “Location (using Google API).”</li>
                <li>The form currently uses fairly generic or “lazy” placeholders; more descriptive placeholders (for example, “Enter your full name” or “Describe your question”) would make the form feel more user-friendly.</li>
            </ul>

            <h5>Overall Technical Notes</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>The site has two CSS validation warnings. Reviewing those warnings and fixing them would help the code fully meet the course’s validation standards.</li>
            </ul>
